TP
--------------

This is a spike to see what kind of test framework you can create if you want something akin to RSpec in Python.

###Goals
The initial goals are:

 * Emulate the spirit, not the specifics of RSpec (stop trying to mimic `should`)
 * Stay Pythonic (use what is already available)
 * Be as intuitive as RSpec or more so.


###Try it

 * Clone this repo
 * Make the `tp` folder visible in your PYTHONPATH
 * Put the `tp` script in your PATH
 * Run like so: `tp example`
